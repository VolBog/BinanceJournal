This project is my home project for the Binance spot trading journal. 
In the future, I will add the following things into this project:
1) Read the wallet from binance (done)
2) Put it in the local database.
3) Get all trades for all tokens in the wallet.

The idea of the following project is to get a clear journal for the spot Binance trading. If you want to join or have ideas, welcome.
